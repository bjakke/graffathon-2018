= Graffathon 2018

My entry "Debuggaajan yö" in http://www.graffathon.fi/2018/ Advanced compo 

Music made with LMMS (https://lmms.io/)

Graphics made with Processing (https://processing.org/)

Processing needs to have the following libraries installed to run
* Minim (available directly in Add Libraries in Processing)
* Moonlander (manual install, https://github.com/anttihirvonen/moonlander)

Code is as-is from the event, might not be pretty :)
